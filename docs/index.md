# My Journey through Self-Hosting

Hi there and welcome. 

This repository is my attempt to document what I’ve learned while getting into self-hosting and homelabbing — including mistakes, wrong assumptions, and the occasional late-night debugging session.

This is not a polished guide. It’s a living document that grows as I learn.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> I'm not an IT professional, and this is not a security or privacy handbook.  
> This repository documents my personal learning journey - including wrong turns and open questions.
> 
> Feel free to follow along, reproduce setups and debug late into the night. Just do so at your own risk.

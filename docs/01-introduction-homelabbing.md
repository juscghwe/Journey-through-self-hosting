# What's homelabbing?

Just to be completely clear, I'm going to use homelabbing and self-hosting synonymous over almost the entire blog. This comes from a very simple reason:  
Up until now I havent figured a real distinction of both besides homelabbing sometimes beeing used as a lab as well even though most use it for self-hosting service first.

## What I thought homelabbing was

I've seen some YouTube videos and read a lot of Reddit and other sources on the topic before heading in and the only answer I could find was:

    A homelab is a sandbox to test out high traffic applications and networking hacks.

This was an awfull conclusion to come at because this just lead me to wondering why not to use virtualisation tools like VMWare. And it completely turned off my excitement for such a hobby.

## How it turned

At some point in time I tried to create an MVP for a routing problem we had at work. As I'm no IT expert, I wanted to test out my proposal first so I wouldn't get laughed out of the office.

But wheter it was [Cisco Packet Tracer](https://www.netacad.com/cisco-packet-tracer) or [VMWare](https://www.vmware.com/), I couldn't get stuff done. Cisco Packet Tracer turned out to be a fun experience but for this special problem simulation, it (or rather I) wasn't fit enough.

And VMWare turned into a complete nightmare of `$ENV`-variables, BIOS-settings, virtualisation conflicts, etc. It completely broke my [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about)-distribution and thereby my [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) setup, leading to a whole cascade of errors.

!!! note
    
    This is not a rant on these products. I just wasn't able to do what i wanted to do based on my learning curve, my abilites and my patience at the time.

# My Journey into Self-Hosting

This repository documents my personal journey into self-hosting and homelabbing.

It’s a **learning journal**, not a polished guide — so it includes mistakes, wrong assumptions, and things I had to (un)learn along the way. The goal is to make the learning process visible, not to pretend it was easy.

Think of this as an onboarding for beginners — written by an enthusiastic beginner.

## What this is (and what it isn’t)

This is:
- A personal learning journal
- A beginner-friendly perspective on self-hosting and homelabbing
- Honest about trade-offs, failures, and complexity
- My first step into journaling and working with GitHub Pages

This is not:
- A security handbook
- A best-practices guide
- Professional IT advice

If you’re just starting out with homelabbing and want to understand *why* things matter — not just *how* to deploy something — this might be useful to you.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome — especially if they:

- point out mistakes, possible improvements, or alternative approaches
- improve explanations
- add clarifications or alternative perspectives
- fix typos or unclear wording

Please keep in mind:  

This project reflects my personal journey and opinions. Not every suggestion will be merged if it changes that scope.  
If in doubt, open an issue first and we’ll talk.

## AI Disclaimer

English is not my first language and this is my first attempt at long-form journaling.

I **use** AI tools to improve language clarity and readability.

I'm **not using** AI tools to generate the journal text or present to you vibe coded snippets.

The content itself reflects my own experiences and decisions.
